# Disconnect Society

A community project encouraging intentional choices about social media and screen time. We believe that widespread dependence on algorithm-driven social media and similar technology is harming public wellbeing and eroding our ability to meaningfully connect with the world around us. Public awareness of these problems is growing, but it's hard for people to quit. Our mission is to help people reduce their dependency on their devices and social media platforms through intentional choice and solidarity.

The pledge at the center of this project is voluntary and self-directed. We hope you'll join us in working toward a culture where we spend our most valuable resource (our time) in the real world, rather than the digital one.
